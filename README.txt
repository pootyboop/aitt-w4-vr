================== OVERVIEW ==================
This submission includes an executable VR experience, a Unity project, and a video playthrough of the experience.
Use a Vive headset in the VR lab for this experience. SteamVR should launch on its own when running the executable, but if it doesn't, quit the application and start SteamVR first.
The video playthrough is intended to be a backup in case the executable fails to launch or input is not working.
The experience includes navigable 3D planets which may cause nausea.



================== CONTROLS ==================
If SteamVR fails to load bindings, please set them up manually:

Locomotion - Left Trackpad
Turning - Right Trackpad
rocketL - Left Trigger
rocketR - Right Trigger
grabObjectL - Left Grip
grabObjectR - Right Grip
pause - Left and Right Menu Button



================== KNOWN ISSUES ==================
- After creating a substantial number of planets, throwing a Sand planet into the sky may cause the player to start floating away. Unfortunately there is no fix for this. Please restart the experience with the Menu Button or quit.
- Snowballs may shrink in size after being thrown. This hopefully shouldn't ruin the experience!
